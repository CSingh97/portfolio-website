                  <h1>About Me</h1>
                  <p>
                     <br>Hey all, my name is Calvin. I'm currently a fifth-year student at <a href="https://www.qc.cuny.edu/">Queens College</a> on track to recieve my bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.cs.qc.cuny.edu/">Computer Science</a>. I aspire to become a full-stack developer because I enjoy solving problems as well using my creativity to solve those problems. <br><br>
                     Growing up, I enjoyed playing video games, and that eventually led me into an interest in technology, and when high school came around I joined a summer school program that included learning about how to code a simple phone app; nothing fancy, but that was my first exposure to what a program could do, and since then it always had my interest. When I applied to college I decided that programming would be a field that I wanted to learn more about, and during my years I got a taste of how challenging some problems could be and it intrigued me because of the ways those probelms can be solved through creativity. Now, I'm trying to find a career doing what I enjoy: creating programs that can challenge me in terms of problem solving and creativity. <br><br>
                     When I'm not doing that, I enjoy playing video games (ask me about my Final Fantasy 14 character!), playing guitar, and tinkering with my computer/linux installation.
